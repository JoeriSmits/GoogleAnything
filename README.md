# Google Anything

Google Anything is an extension for the Visual Studio Code editor. It's main purpose is to enable you to search on Google inside your editor. No more switching windows to quickly search something.

## Features

Use command ```Google``` to start searching. After you typed your search query a window will open with Google's search results. The color theme of the window matches your editor's preference.

## Extension Settings

This extension works on top of Google Custom Search. The plugin works by default on a Custom Search created by the repo owner. If you want to use your own Custom Search you need to configure the `GoogleAnything` user setting.

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `GoogleAnything.GoogleApiKey`: Google API Key for custom search
* `GoogleAnything.GoogleCX`: CX Code for the custom search
